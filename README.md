# CMML Interface
This is a Chat componen built with React. It serves as an interface for typing, sending, receiving and correct rendering of the CMML type of messages.


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Integrate CMML into yor chat
To use the [CMML compiler](https://github.com/victor0198utm/CMML/), we provided the cmml_builder.js file, located in "./src". It contains a function which returns an HTML structure, based on the back-end's response.
